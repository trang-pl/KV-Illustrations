## Data Flow Validation

### ✅ End-to-End Data Pipeline
1. **Input:** Environment variables (API token, file key)
2. **Stage 1:** Credentials validation → Context building
3. **Stage 2:** Figma API call → Raw file data
4. **Stage 3:** Node processing → Filtered export candidates
5. **Stage 4:** Export execution → SVG files (technical issue encountered)
6. **Stage 5:** Report generation → Analytics and summaries
7. **Stage 6:** Backup creation → Data preservation

### 🔄 Context Propagation
- ✅ Credentials properly extracted and passed between stages
- ✅ API token correctly propagated to Figma client
- ✅ File key correctly resolved from config
- ✅ Session management working correctly
- ✅ Error handling and recovery functional

## Issues Identified & Mitigations

### 🚨 Critical Issues
1. **Export Engine Data Structure Issue**
   - **Problem:** 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'
   - **Impact:** 0/2 files exported successfully
   - **Root Cause:** Likely mismatch in processed node data structure
   - **Mitigation:** Debug and fix data format compatibility

### ⚠️ Minor Issues
1. **Report Generator Using Cached Data**
   - **Problem:** Reports show old execution data
   - **Impact:** Metrics don't reflect current run
   - **Mitigation:** Implement proper data refresh mechanism

2. **Backup Not Created for Export Results**
   - **Problem:** No actual files to backup
   - **Impact:** Backup directory empty
   - **Mitigation:** Resolve export issue first
